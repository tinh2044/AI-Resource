This repository contains books and documents related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
The goal is to create a clear and useful learning resource for study and reference to solve specific problems.
These are documents I have collected throughout my studies. I hope everyone will find it helpful!

If you find it useful, please give me a star ‚≠ê. It will be the motivation for me to continue developing this repo.

If you don't know where to start learning, check out: [AI Roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#machine-learning-roadmap).
This roadmap will help you learn all about ML and DL, then you can dive deeper into a specific area.
